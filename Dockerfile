# ✅ Grant execution permission to Maven wrapper
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

# ✅ Build the application and apply Liquibase migrations
RUN ./mvnw clean package && ./mvnw liquibase:update

# ✅ Step 2: Run the application using a minimal Java image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# ✅ Set the working directory for the runtime container
WORKDIR /app

# ✅ Copy the built JAR from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# ✅ Expose the application port
#EXPOSE 8080
